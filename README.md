# Color Schemes

A collection of Python scripts designed to assist with color analysis and visualization, tailored for use by designers, developers, and data enthusiasts. These tools streamline the creation of visually appealing and accessible color palettes, aiding in tasks such as UI/UX design, web development, and image analysis.

## Scripts

### 1. Generate and Visualize Color Variations

**Description**: This script generates and visualizes lighter and darker variations of a given base color. It helps designers create consistent hover effects and ensures that color schemes remain visually appealing and accessible.

**Use Cases**:
- Web Design
- UI/UX Design

**Features**:
- Generate lighter and darker color variations
- Visualize the colors together
- Determine text color for readability

### 2. Extract and Visualize Dominant Colors from an Image

**Description**: This script extracts and visualizes the dominant colors from an image.

**Use Cases**:
- Design and Art: Extract color palettes from images for projects.
- Data Analysis: Study color distributions in images.
- Web Development: Generate color schemes for websites based on images.
- Marketing: Analyze brand colors in images for consistency.

**Features**:
- Extract dominant colors from an image
- Visualize the extracted colors

### 3. Extract and Visualize Dominant Colors from an Image

**Description**: This script extracts and visualizes the dominant colors from an image, similar to script 2.

**Use Cases**:
